# Contributing to Konbini

## Developer overview

Konbini is written almost-purely in **BunJS**, although we heavily rely on the NodeJS API for base functionalities like filesystem, path handling, and HTTP requests.

There's minimal dependencies: `yaml`, `openpgp`, `@zakahacecosas/string-utils`, `glob`, TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier & `@types/bun`.
