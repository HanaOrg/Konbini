# Verified developers

To request a verification badge, make a Pull Request to the authors registry, adding a `verified: true` field to your author manifest.

> [!TIP]
> If all criteria is already met at the moment of making your 1st registration PR, you can set `verified: true` from that moment.

Once received, we'll review your profile, published packages and their repos, and check that you meet the following criteria:

- At least one update has been released to any of your published packages within the last 30 days.
- At least one **non-trivial** commit has been made to any of your published packages' repositories within the last 15 days.
- A valid email address, website, and biography are provided in your author manifest.
- Your history is clean â€” meaning no confirmed reports of spam, hacking, or other malicious practices against you exist on any platform.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **"Valid website" implies not just provided, but provided and proven to be owned by you.**
>
> To prove ownership, make sure to create a `kbi.txt` file on your website's root (so, for `www.site.com`, be it `www.site.com/kbi.txt`) containing nothing but your author ID. This should be done before applying, as we'll check for it before responding to you.

If all these criteria are met, your PR will be merged, and your profile will start displaying a verification badge next to your name.

Verification won't be removed by loss of the time-based requirements (e.g., you could spend 60 days without updating a package and stay verified). However, loss of the website or email used for verification, or most importantly any violation of our ToS or report of generally bad conduct anywhere will result in a (permanent) removal of verification.
