# Verified developers

To request a verification badge, make a Pull Request to the authors registry, adding a `verified: true` field to your author manifest.

> [!TIP]
> If all criteria is already met at the moment of making your 1st registration PR, you can set `verified: true` from that moment.

Once received, we'll check that you meet the following criteria:

- At least one update has been released to any of your published packages within the last 90 days.
- At least one **non-trivial** commit has been made to any of your published packages' repositories within the last 60 days.
- A valid email address, website, and biography are provided in your author manifest.
- Your history is clean â€” meaning no confirmed reports of spam, hacking, or other malicious practices against you on any platform.

If all these criteria are met, your PR will be merged, and your profile will start displaying a verification badge next to your name.
