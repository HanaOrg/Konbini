# Konbini releases

Konbini releases follow a simple, predictable format. Each component appears five times, in the form of `[module name]-[platform]`.

There are three modules (two required); KBI, KBU, and KPAK SFX. KBI is Konbini itself, KBU is the updater, and KPAK SFX is an optional module for creating self extracting Konpaks.
