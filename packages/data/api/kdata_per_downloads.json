Using WebP, webmasters and web developers can create smaller, richer images that make the web faster.\nWebP lossless images are [26% smaller](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/webp_lossless_alpha_study#results) in size compared to PNGs. WebP lossy images are [25-34% smaller](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/webp_study) than comparable JPEG images at equivalent SSIM quality index.\nLossless WebP **supports transparency** (also known as alpha channel) at a cost of just [22% additional bytes](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/webp_lossless_alpha_study#results). For cases when lossy RGB compression is acceptable, **lossy WebP also supports transparency**, typically providing 3× smaller file sizes compared to PNG.\nLossy, lossless and transparency are all supported in **animated WebP images**, which can provide reduced sizes compared to GIF and APNG.\n","license":"BSD3Clause","author":"org.google","icon":"https://developers.google.com/static/speed/webp/images/webp-devsite-icon_72.png","homepage":"https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/","docs":"https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/using","categories":["DEVELOPMENT"],"age_rating":{"money":false,"social":false,"substances":false,"violence":false},"telemetry":false,"accent":"#7ed32a","id":"org.google.webp","downloads":{"installs":[],"removals":[],"active":0}},"org.missioncenter.missioncenter":{"downloads":{"installs":[],"removals":[],"active":0},"bs":true,"name":"Mission Center","author":"org.kde","type":"gui","slogan":"Color selector and palette editor","homepage":"https://missioncenter.io","icon":"https://gitlab.com/mission-center-devs/mission-center/-/raw/main/data/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/io.missioncenter.MissionCenter.svg?ref_type=heads","desc":"Monitor your CPU, Memory, Disk, Network and GPU usage, accompanied by a per app and process breakdown of these statistics\nFeatures:\n- Monitor overall or per-thread CPU usage - See system process, thread, and handle count, uptime, clock speed (base and current), cache sizes - Monitor RAM and Swap usage - See a breakdown how the memory is being used by the system - Monitor Disk utilization and transfer rates - Monitor network utilization and transfer speeds - See network interface information such as network card name, connection type (Wi-Fi or Ethernet), wireless speeds and frequency, hardware address, IP address - Monitor overall GPU usage, video encoder and decoder usage, memory usage and power consumption, powered by the popular NVTOP project - Monitor system fans - See a breakdown of resource usage by app and process - Supports a minified summary view for simple monitoring - Use hardware accelerated rendering for all the graphs in an effort to reduce CPU and overall resource usage - Uses GTK4 and Libadwaita - Written in Rust\nLimitations (there is ongoing work to overcome all of these):\n- Intel GPU monitoring is only supported for Broadwell and later GPUs; and does not support VRAM, power, or temperature monitoring - When using Linux Mint/Cinnamon, launched applications may not show up in the \"Applications\" section (Upstream issue: https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon/issues/12015)\nComments, suggestions, bug reports and contributions welcome\n","images":[{"text":"CPU view","link":"https://gitlab.com/mission-center-devs/mission-center/-/raw/main/screenshots/0001-cpu.png?ref_type=heads"},{"text":"Memory view","link":"https://gitlab.com/mission-center-devs/mission-center/-/raw/main/screenshots/0002-memory.png?ref_type=heads"},{"text":"Disk view","link":"https://gitlab.com/mission-center-devs/mission-center/-/raw/main/screenshots/0003-disk.png?ref_type=heads"},{"text":"Ethernet view","link":"https://gitlab.com/mission-center-devs/mission-center/-/raw/main/screenshots/0004-ethernet.png?ref_type=heads"},{"text":"WiFi view","link":"https://gitlab.com/mission-center-devs/mission-center/-/raw/main/screenshots/0005-wifi.png?ref_type=heads"},{"text":"GPU view","link":"https://gitlab.com/mission-center-devs/mission-center/-/raw/main/screenshots/0006-gpu.png?ref_type=heads"},{"text":"CPU fan view","link":"https://gitlab.com/mission-center-devs/mission-center/-/raw/main/screenshots/0007-fan.png?ref_type=heads"},{"text":"Running apps view","link":"https://gitlab.com/mission-center-devs/mission-center/-/raw/main/screenshots/0008-apps.png?ref_type=heads"},{"text":"Running services view","link":"https://gitlab.com/mission-center-devs/mission-center/-/raw/main/screenshots/0008-services.png?ref_type=heads"}],"categories":["SYSTEM_UTIL"],"age_rating":{"money":false,"social":false,"substances":false,"violence":false},"license":"GPLv3","repository":"gl:mission-center-devs/mission-center","platforms":{"linux64":"fpak:io.missioncenter.MissionCenter","linuxArm":"fpak:io.missioncenter.MissionCenter","mac64":null,"macArm":null,"win64":null},"telemetry":false,"accent":"#3f3a48","id":"org.missioncenter.missioncenter"},"usr.vixalien.sticky":{"bs":true,"name":"Sticky Notes","author":"usr.vixalien","type":"gui","slogan":"Pin notes to your desktop","categories":["PERSONAL","OFFICE"],"icon":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vixalien/sticky/refs/heads/main/data/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/com.vixalien.sticky.svg","desc":"Sticky Notes is a simple sticky notes app for GNOME.

Dolphin's right-click menu provides with many quick actions that let you compress, share, and duplicate files, among many other things. You can also add your own custom actions.\nDolphin is very lightweight, but at the same time, you can adapt it to your specific needs. This means that you can carry out your file management exactly the way you want to. Dolphin supports three different view modes: a classic grid view of all the files, a more detailed view, and a tree view. You can also configure most of Dolphin's behavior.\nDolphin can display files and folders from many Internet cloud services and other remote machines as if they were right there on your desktop.\nDolphin also comes with an integrated terminal that allows you to run commands on the current folder.
