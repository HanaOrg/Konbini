It gave too many problems as if it's shown live, it cannot be read by the CLI.\n- Now, the \"report\" shown after a cleanup is no longer hidden behind a flag.\n- Now threshold for notifications were made the same and reduced to 30 seconds.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed (FINAL and HOPEFULLY) `buildCmd`.\n- Fixed a missing line break causing `- /path/to/fileand 7 more files` in `commit`.\n- Fixed elapsed time showing 0m 0s sometimes if it only took milliseconds.\n- Fixed calculation of elapsed times. [Thanks.](https://stackoverflow.com/a/21294619)\n\n### Removed\n\n- (Breaking) `--verbose` is no longer a feature anywhere. Also, removed the ability to see live output of any command that you run.\n  - This was made to fix bugs. Plus, now error dumps should be more likely to have that same output of the erroring command.\n\n","downloads":{"installs":[{"app":"org.fuckingnode.fuckingnode","version":"4.1.0","sys":"win64","country":"ES","timestamp":1755269414988},{"app":"org.fuckingnode.fuckingnode","version":"4.1.0","sys":"win64","country":"ES","timestamp":1755269865508}],"removals":[],"active":2},"name":"FuckingNode","author":"org.fuckingnode","type":"cli","slogan":"The chaos of maintaining JavaScript projects ends here","homepage":"https://fuckingnode.github.io","docs":"https://fuckingnode.github.io/manual/","icon":"https://fuckingnode.github.io/fkn_icon.webp","maintainers":[{"name":"ZakaHaceCosas","link":"https://zakahacecosas.github.io/","github":"ZakaHaceCosas"}],"desc":"**FuckingNode is a CLI tool that automates tasks and gives you tools to make JavaScript development less of a f*cking headache.** We can't fix your bugs, but we can automate most headache-giving tasks across all of your NodeJS/Deno/Bun projects and give you a set of tools to make JS development great again.\\n## Features\n- automated cleanup of JS projects\n- automated cleanup of global caches (especially useful for pnpm or Bun, where a single global cache exists)\n- automated updates of JS projects' dependencies\n- automated linting of JS projects\n- automated prettying of JS projects\n- automated removal of unneeded files (e.g. dist/, out/...)\n- automated commit of lint / prettify / update changes in your code\\n\n\\- **from a single command.** It's not magic, it's FuckingNode-and that name is shipping to production.\n## And there's more\n- automated release / update process of npm / jsr packages, from a single command\n- automated cloning of a repo, installation of dependencies, and opening of your favorite editor for a project, from a single command\n- automated cross-manager (e.g. npm -> pnpm) or cross-runtime (e.g. NodeJS/npm -> Bun) migration, from a single command\n- a security audit assistant that analyzes vulnerabilities and tells you if they do affect your project or can be safely ignored, from a single command\n- addition of a pre-configured tsconfig.json or .gitignore file for your project, from a single command\n- automated removal of entire node_modules across all of your projects for storage emergencies, from, you guessed it, a single command\"\n","images":[{"text":"Let all your projects get cleaned, dependencies updated, code prettified...
