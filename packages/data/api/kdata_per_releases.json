Now when these \"errors\" happen, version is assumed to be 'Unknown' and no warning shows up.\n- Fixed the informative comment in exported FnCPFs showing the CLI's name and version twice.\n- Fixed `FKNDBG_PROC` not working on Windows.\n- Fixed a critical mistake where hard cleanup would delete your entire Cargo installation.\n- Fixed a theoretical issue where the program would crash if a non-string value was console logged.\n- Fixed error messages for some hard cleanup scenarios.","name":"FuckingNode","author":"org.fuckingnode","type":"cli","slogan":"The chaos of maintaining JavaScript projects ends here","homepage":"https://fuckingnode.github.io","docs":"https://fuckingnode.github.io/manual/","icon":"https://fuckingnode.github.io/fkn_icon.webp","maintainers":[{"name":"ZakaHaceCosas","link":"https://zakahacecosas.github.io/","github":"ZakaHaceCosas"}],"desc":"**FuckingNode is a CLI tool that automates tasks and gives you tools to make JavaScript development less of a f*cking headache.** We can't fix your bugs, but we can automate most headache-giving tasks across all of your NodeJS/Deno/Bun projects and give you a set of tools to make JS development great again.\\n## Features\n- automated cleanup of JS projects\n- automated cleanup of global caches (especially useful for pnpm or Bun, where a single global cache exists)\n- automated updates of JS projects' dependencies\n- automated linting of JS projects\n- automated prettying of JS projects\n- automated removal of unneeded files (e.g. dist/, out/...)\n- automated commit of lint / prettify / update changes in your code\\n\n\\- **from a single command.** It's not magic, it's FuckingNode-and that name is shipping to production.\n## And there's more\n- automated release / update process of npm / jsr packages, from a single command\n- automated cloning of a repo, installation of dependencies, and opening of your favorite editor for a project, from a single command\n- automated cross-manager (e.g. npm -> pnpm) or cross-runtime (e.g. NodeJS/npm -> Bun) migration, from a single command\n- a security audit assistant that analyzes vulnerabilities and tells you if they do affect your project or can be safely ignored, from a single command\n- addition of a pre-configured tsconfig.json or .gitignore file for your project, from a single command\n- automated removal of entire node_modules across all of your projects for storage emergencies, from, you guessed it, a single command\"\n","images":[{"text":"Let all your projects get cleaned, dependencies updated, code prettified...
