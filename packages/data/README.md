# Konbini Data

This is the Konbini Data API (codename KData), hosted on Vercel. It serves data from packages, including manifests, downloads, and changelogs. Data is fetched from GitHub by our own hardware, then parsed, analyzed, and properly uploaded to this API.

To see how data is fetched, refer to Konbini Guard (this repo/packages/client/guard).
